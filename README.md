# Tybalt

Tybalt is a bot I developed primarily for my own personal use in my Guild Wars 2 guild's Discord server. He utilises the Discord.js and the Discord.js-Commando frameworks. I never published the initial version of Tybalt as I more or less just hacked him together. My goal for this second version was partially to implement a few more features I'd been contemplating for a few months, but also to make him more maintainable.

When I initially started working on Tybalt, my goal was simply to have a Discord bot to help me manage the server. His duties were for instance to post and track our raid logs, as well as greet newcomers to the server. As I enjoy writing, I tried to incorporate some personality in him.
